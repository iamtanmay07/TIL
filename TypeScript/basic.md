## TypeScript
- browser can't run typescript, so eventually typescript code is converted to the JS only...
- Typescript is all about your static typing ! (we need to define type of everything)

### installing typescript
> npm i -g typescript

## RUN typescript 
> tcs index.ts

- this index.ts file is converted to the index.js file

- if there's error like "cannot redeclare scopped based variable" then just add `export {}` at the end of the code
